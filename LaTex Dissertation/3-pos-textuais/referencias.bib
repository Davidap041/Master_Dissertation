  abstract = {To respond rapidly to the highly volatile market, the emerging reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) have brought forward two challenging issues, namely, how to build rapid a formal model of an initial manufacturing configuration and how to yield the goal model from the existing one along with manufacturing configuration changes (reconfiguration). As for the issues, we present in this paper a method for rapid design of Petri net (PN) formalized models of RMS, intended for supervisory control and logic control of RMS, as well as a method for automated reconfiguration of the models. Firstly, we present an improved net rewriting system (INRS) for dynamically operating net transformation, unlike its predecessor-net rewriting system, where the initial behavioral properties of the underlying PN rewritten can be preserved during the transformation. Subsequently, the paper proposes the three-phase method for rapid design of initial full PN models of reconfigurable manufacturing cells (RMCs). In this method, activity diagrams of Unified Modeling Languages version 2 (UML 2) are used to describe manufacturing configurations, firstly; then the sub-activity diagrams are transformed into PN sub-models; finally, the PN sub-models are automated synthesized into a full model by the approach of INRS. Further, we present a model reconfiguration method for this class of PN models. The method compares changes in activity diagrams of the existing and goal manufacturing configurations and converts them into net rewriting rules of INRS. By applying the rules obtained, the existing PN model can reconfigure into a new one for the goal manufacturing configuration. No matter the design method or the reconfiguration method, the behavioral properties of the obtained PN models, e.g., liveness, boundedness, or reversibility, can be guaranteed and thereby the efforts of verification can be avoided. Finally, rapid design of a PN model of a reconfigurable manufacturing cell, as well as its automated reconfiguration, is illustrated with the help of an example. The result indicates the validity of the methods.}

It uses a layered approach based on Coloured Petri Nets for modeling complex, concurrent conversations among agents. In this approach, each agent employs a Coloured Petri Net model that allows agents to follow a plan specifying their interactions. It also allows programmers to plan for the concurrent feature of the conversation and make sure that all possible states of the problem space are considered. The framework assists the agents in identifying and adapting different strategies for teammates and task selection dynamically. The agents can change their strategies in the course of dynamic environments to improve their performance. We have examined the performance of the agents in this framework by developing some task selection and teammate selection strategies for agents in a disaster scenario.},

To this end, we introduce an automated model generation scheme that builds upon a coarse description of the production process and the factory. The generated model is based on a Petri Net representation of the production process, which we slightly enhance to separate automatically evolving processes from consciously taken manufacturing decisions. From the Petri Net model, we deduce a state space description which can be used for the synthesis of feedback control for the manufacturing system. The model generation is illustrated with an example, and further possibilities to utilize and enhance the model are discussed.}

Sensing for dynamic variables are gyroscope and accelerometers connected through an I2C protocol to a launchpad MSP432 from Texas Instruments, assembled with an ARM M4F processor. The embedded system allows sensor fusion and input signal generation such that a gray box identification may be performed.

  abstract={The problem of assigning tasks to a group of robots acting in a dynamic environment is a fundamental issue for a multirobot system (MRS) and several techniques have been studied to address this problem. Such techniques usually rely on the assumption that tasks to be assigned are inserted into the system in a coherent fashion. In this work we consider a scenario where tasks to be accomplished are perceived by the robots during mission execution. This issue has a significative impact on the task allocation process and, at the same time, makes it strictly dependent on perception capabilities of robots. More specifically, we present an asynchronous distributed mechanism based on Token Passing for allocating tasks in a team of robots. We tested and evaluated our approach by means of experiments both in a simulated environment and with real robots; our scenario comprises a set of robots that must cooperatively collect a set of objects scattered in the working environment. Each object collection task requires the cooperation of two robots. The experiments in the simulation environment allowed us to extract quantitative data from several missions and in different operative conditions and to characterize in a statistical way the results of our approach, especially when the team size increases},

abstract = {Although the contract net protocol answers some of the questions in cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS), it raises many others that CDPS researchers are still trying to answer. In contract net protocol, an agent may play the role of a manager or a bidder. Without a coordination mechanism, a manager may acquire excessive resources from the bidders in forming a collaborative network to execute the assigned task and thus hinder the progress of the tasks assigned to other managers due to resource contention. As a result, application of contract net protocol may not always lead to feasible solutions to accomplish tasks effectively. As a general framework for exchanging messages, the original contract net protocol does not prescribe how agents should cooperate. How to develop a collaborative mechanism to effectively perform the tasks is an important issue. This paper aims to improve the insufficiency of the contract net by developing a mechanism to facilitate cooperation of agents to accomplish their tasks while avoiding undesirable states and enhance the overall system performance in manufacturing systems. To achieve these objectives, detail process models about how agents accomplish their tasks are required. Due to the advantages in modeling concurrent, synchronous and/or asynchronous activities, Petri nets are adopted in this paper. Based on Petri net models, we study the information needed for agents to make cooperative decisions, mechanism to make agents cooperate, and how to enhance the performance in the system level by taking advantage of the agents’ cooperation capabilities. To characterize the condition for cooperation, we represent the collaborative networks formed based on the contract net protocol with Petri nets and then find the condition for a collaborative network to be feasible. The feasible condition also serves as a condition for the development of cooperation mechanism for managers. We propose a cooperation mechanism based on the idea of resource donation, including unilateral resource donation and reciprocal resource donation. Implementation architecture has also been proposed to realize our methodology.}

abstract = {With the rising urge to mitigate the green house effect, reducing the energy consumption of the freight train attracts much attention. Multiple constraints should be taken into account to solve the energy-efficient control problem, which can be reformulated as the multi-objective optimization. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for the multi-objective speed trajectory optimization with the goal of the energy-efficiency, punctuality and accurate parking simultaneously. Since the solution space for the optimization problem in this paper is large and discrete, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network is proposed to achieve the fast approximation of the optimal value function instead of the lookup Q-table. Meanwhile, a new architecture, including the embedding matrix, is used to model the control sequence that generates the speed trajectory. Besides, this paper constructs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework to train the GRU network without relying on the prior knowledge of the freight train model. Finally, the Intelligent Train Operation (ITO) algorithm is proposed and verified, using the data of Beijing–Guangzhou Railway Line and HXD1B electric locomotive. The case studies indicate that the reward function for the ITO algorithm converges rapidly and the energy consumption monotonically decreases with the trip time, which satisfies the multiple optimization objectives. In terms of saving the energy consumption, the ITO algorithm performs better than Fuzzy Predictive Control (FPC), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the field test data. The computation time of different speed trajectories demonstrates that the ITO algorithm is applicable to generating the optimal speed trajectory off-line.}

We restrict our attention to delay cases aiming at finding optimal speed profiles, which reduce delays and save energy consumption. A multi-train trajectory optimization method is proposed to find optimal meeting locations, arrival/departure times, and speed trajectories of multiple trains within the time and speed windows. The proposed method first finds timetable constraint sets for trains under delayed situations. The timetable constraint sets provide drivable, feasible, and energy-efficient time and speed windows along the trains’ routes. The multi-train trajectory optimization method uses minimizing energy consumption and reducing delays as the objective functions, and takes into account each train’s operational constraints as well as constraints to avoid conflicts between adjacent trains. Three driving strategies of delay-recovery, energy-efficient and on-time driving, are proposed and combined in the optimization objective selection for different delay scenarios. The multi-train trajectory optimization is formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem and solved by a pseudospectral method. The proposed method is applied in case studies of opposite trains running on a Dutch single-track railway corridor with different initial delay scenarios. The results show that our method is able to produce a feasible schedule with energy-efficient speed trajectories for all interacting trains.}
